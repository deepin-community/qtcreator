# Writing Qt Design Studio Documentation

The Qt Design Studio Manual is based on the Qt Creator Manual, with additional
topics. When building the Qt Design Studio Manual, parts of the Qt Creator
Manual are pulled in from Qt Creator sources. This is enabled by creating
separate table of contents files for each Manual and by using defines
to hide and show information depending on which Manual is being built.

Because branding information is needed to use the correct product name and
version.
