    \title Installing \QDS

    Install \QDS using \QOI. If you have Qt installed, install \QDS using
    \QMT. If your business wants to explore \QDS, get
    the free Qt evaluation package. If you're a student or a teacher,
    get \QDS using the Qt Edu license.

    \QDS is available on several operating systems. For more information, see
    \l{Supported Platforms}.

    \section1 Using \QOI

    Download \QOI from your Qt Account. If you don't have a Qt Account,
    create one \l {Qt Account}{here}.

    \list 1
        \li Open \QOI.
        \li Select \uicontrol {\QDS}.
            \image studio-installation.webp "Qt Design Studio selected in Qt Online Installer"
        \li Select \uicontrol Next and follow the instructions of the
            installer to complete the installation.

    from your Qt Account under \uicontrol Downloads > \uicontrol Products.
