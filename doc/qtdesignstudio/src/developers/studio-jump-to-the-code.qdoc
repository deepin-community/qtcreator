    \title Jump to the Code

    Jump to the code is a feature that gives you instant access to a particular
    part of the code. It takes you to the \uicontrol {Code} view location of a particular
    component, \uicontrol {State}, or \uicontrol {Connection}.

    You can jump to the code from:
    \list
        \li \uicontrol {Navigator} view
        \li \uicontrol {2D} view
        \li \uicontrol {States} view
        \li \uicontrol {Connections} view
    \endlist

    \section1 Jump to the Code from the Navigator View

    \list 1
        \li Right-click on a component in the \uicontrol {Navigator} view.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Jump to the Code}.
    \endlist

    \section1 Jump to the Code from the 2D View

    \list 1
        \li Right-click on a component in the \uicontrol {2D} view.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Jump to the Code}.
    \endlist

    \note Alternatively, you can select the component in the \uicontrol {Navigator} view
    or in the \uicontrol {2D} view and press \key {F4}. That takes you to the code
    location in the \uicontrol {Code} view.

    \section1 Jump to the Code from the States View

    \list 1
        \li Locate the state you want to check in the \uicontrol {States} view.
        \li Select \inlineimage icons/browse-button.png
            to open additional options.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Jump to the Code}.
    \endlist

    \section1 Jump to the Code from the Connections View

    \list 1
        \li Select a connection in the \uicontrol {Connections} view.
        \li Select \inlineimage icons/jump-to-code-16px.png
            to jump to the code segment related to the connection.
    \endlist
