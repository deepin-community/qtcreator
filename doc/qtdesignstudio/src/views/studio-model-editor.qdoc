    \brief Create, manage, import, and export data models.

    \section1 Creating a Data Model

    To create a data model:
    \list 1
      \li In \uicontrol {Model Editor}, select \inlineimage {icons/zoomIn.png}.
      \li Enter a name and select \uicontrol {Create}.
    \endlist

    This creates a single-cell table.
