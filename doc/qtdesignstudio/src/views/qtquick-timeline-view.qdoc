    \title Timeline

    \brief Animate the properties of components.

    You can use the timeline and keyframe based editor in the
    \uicontrol Timeline view to animate the properties of
    \l{glossary_component}{components}. The view is empty until
    you create a timeline.

    \image studio-timeline-empty.webp "Empty Timeline view"

    Select the \inlineimage icons/plus.png
    (\uicontrol {Add Timeline}) button to
    \l{Creating a Timeline}{create a timeline} and specify settings for it in
    the \uicontrol {Timeline Settings} dialog.

    When you select \uicontrol Close, the \uicontrol Timeline view appears.
    It now displays a toolbar and a ruler but no
    keyframe tracks.

    To animate component properties in the \uicontrol Timeline view, you
    must \l{Setting Keyframe Values}{insert keyframes} for them. In the
    \l Properties view, select \inlineimage icons/action-icon.png
    (\uicontrol Actions) > \uicontrol {Insert Keyframe} for a property that you
    want to animate. A keyframe track is generated for each component that you
    insert keyframes for.

    You can now select \inlineimage icons/local_record_keyframes.png
    to \l{Setting Keyframe Values}{record changes} in component properties
    while you \l{Navigating in Timeline}{navigate the timeline}.

    The following video shows how to insert keyframes for component properties
    and to animate them in \uicontrol Timeline:

    To try it yourself, follow the \l{Log In UI - Timeline} tutorial.

    For more information about creating timeline animations, see
    \l{Creating Timeline Animations}.

        \li Select the \uicontrol {To Start (Home)}, \uicontrol {Previous (,)},
            \uicontrol {Next (.)}, or \uicontrol {To End (End)} buttons (3), or
            use the keyboard shortcuts to move to the first, previous, next, or
            last frame on the timeline.
        \li Enter the number of a frame in the current keyframe field (4) to
            move to that frame.
        \li Select the \uicontrol Previous and \uicontrol Next buttons next to
            a property name on the timeline (5) to move to the previous or next
            keyframe for that property.
    \endlist

    \section1 Zooming in Timeline

    Use the slider on the toolbar to set the zooming level in the
    \uicontrol Timeline view. Select the \inlineimage icons/zoom_small.png
    and \inlineimage icons/zoom_big.png
    buttons to zoom out of or into the view.

    \section1 Setting Keyframe Track Color

    To change the color of a keyframe track, select \uicontrol {Override Color}
    in the context menu, and then select a color in the \l{Picking Colors}
