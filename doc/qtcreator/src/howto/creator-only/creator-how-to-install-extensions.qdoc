    You can sort extensions according to their name, vendor, popularity, or
    update date.

    extensions, select \inlineimage icons/settings.png.

    \title Load extensions

    In the experimental \uicontrol Extensions mode, you can load and unload
    extensions from the computer or the web.

    To load extensions when you start \QC:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \uicontrol Extensions.
            \image qtcreator-extension-mode.webp {Extensions mode}
        \li Select an extension.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Load on start}.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Restart Now} to restart \QC and load the plugin.
    \endlist

    \section1 Load extensions from the web

    By default, the \uicontrol Extensions mode lists extensions installed on the
    computer. You can also list extensions from external repositories in the web.

    To load extensions from the web:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol Extensions.
            \image qtcreator-preferences-extensions.webp {Extensions in Preferences}
        \li Select \uicontrol {Use external repository}.
        \li In \uicontrol {Server URL} enter the URL of the external repository.
        \li Select \uicontrol {OK}.
    \endlist

    \title Install extensions

    To install extensions to \QC:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \uicontrol Extensions.
            \image qtcreator-extension-mode.webp {Extensions mode}
        \li Select an extension.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Install}.

    \section1 Security considerations

    \QC does not check extensions from external vendors for security flaws or
    malicious intent, so be careful when installing them, as it might leave your
    computer vulnerable to attacks such as hacking, malware, and phishing.

    Before you install an extension from an external vendor:

    \list
        \li Check that the extension is compatible with your \QC version and
            other extensions that you install. You can find this information in
            the description of the extension in the \uicontrol Extensions mode.
        \li Check what other users are saying about the extension and how they
            rate it.
        \li Make sure the vendor is reputable and known for creating high-quality
            extensions.
        \li Check that the extension package was recently updated. Outdated
            extensions present a bigger risk.
        \li Check that the extension has good documentation and other means of
            support.
        \li Check that the extension mostly has features that you need.
            All extensions that are loaded on start make \QC start a bit slower.
    \endlist
