    \title Configure SSH connections

    To protect the connections between \QC and a device, install the \l{OpenSSH}
    suite, which includes the \c ssh, \c sftp, and \c ssh-keygen tools on the
    computer.

    SSH connections are established via an OpenSSH client running in master
    mode, if possible. By default, multiple sessions are shared over a single SSH
    onnection. Establishing a connection once and then re-using it for subsequent
    run and deploy procedures reduces connection setup overhead particularly
    with embedded devices. Because connection sharing is not supported on
    Windows, a new SSH connection is created for each deploy or run procedure.

    To set the paths to the directories where the tools are installed:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol SSH.
            \image qtcreator-ssh-options.png "SSH preferences"
        \li Clear \uicontrol {Enable connection sharing} to
            create a new SSH connection for each deploy and run procedure. This
            option is grayed on Windows, where connection sharing is not
            supported.
        \li In \uicontrol {Connection sharing timeout}, specify the
            timeout for reusing the SSH connection in minutes.
        \li In \uicontrol {Path to ssh executable}, enter the path
            to the directory where the OpenSSH executable is installed.
        \li In \uicontrol {Path to sftp executable}, enter the path
            to the directory where the SFTP executable is installed.
        \li In \uicontrol {Path to ssh-askpass executable}, enter the
            path to the directory where the ssh-askpass executable is installed.
            Usually, you can use the default path that points to the
            implementation of the tool delivered with \QC, qtc-askpass.
        \li In \uicontrol {Path to ssh-keygen executable}, enter the
            path to the directory where the ssh-keygen executable is installed.
    \endlist

    \title Generate SSH keys

    To protect the connections between \QC and a device, use \l{OpenSSH}.

    If you do not have an SSH public and private key pair, you can generate it
    in \QC. The connection wizard can create the key pair for you, or you can
    create it separately.

    You can specify key length and the key algorithm, RSA or ECDSA.
    If you only use the keys to protect connections to the emulator or
    device, you can use the default values.

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol Devices
        \li Select \uicontrol {Create New}.
            \image qtcreator-ssh-key-configuration.png {SSH Key Configuration dialog}
        \li In \uicontrol {Private key file}, select the location to save
            the private key.
            \uicontrol {Public key file} displays the location to save the
            corresponding public key.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Generate And Save Key Pair} to generate and save the
            keys at the specified locations.
