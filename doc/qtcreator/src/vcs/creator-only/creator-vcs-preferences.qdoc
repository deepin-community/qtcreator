    \title Set up version control systems

    \QC uses the version control system's command-line clients to access your
    repositories. Make sure that the command-line clients are in the \c{PATH}
    environment variable, or specify the path to the command-line client
    executable in the version control system specific tab in \preferences >
    \uicontrol {Version Control}.

    The other configuration options depend on the version control system.
    After you set up the version control system, use the command line to check
    that everything works (for example, use the status command). If no issues
    arise, you should be ready to use the system also from \QC.

    For more information on using Git for Windows, see
    \l {Use Git for Windows}.

    \section1 General VCS preferences

    Go to \preferences > \uicontrol {Version Control}
    > \uicontrol General to specify settings for submit messages:

    \image qtcreator-preferences-vcs-general.webp {General tab in Version Control preferences}

    \list
        \li \uicontrol{Wrap submit messages at} limits the line length of a
            submit message to the specified number of characters.
        \li \uicontrol{Submit message check script} is a script or program that
            performs checks on the submit message before
            submitting. The submit message is the script's first
            parameter. If there is an error, the script should output a
            message on standard error and return a non-zero exit code.
        \li \uicontrol{User/alias configuration file} is a text file that lists
            author names in mailmap format. For each author, you must specify a
            real name and email address and optionally an alias and a second
            email address. For example:
            \code
            Jon Doe <Jon.Doe@company.com> jdoe <jdoe@somemail.com>
            Hans Mustermann <Hans.Mustermann@company.com> hm <info@company.com>
            \endcode
            After you specify a file in this field, you can select authors
            as values of the submit message fields in the \uicontrol Nicknames dialog.
        \li \uicontrol{User fields configuration file} is a simple text file
            consisting of lines specifying submit message fields that take
            authors as values, for example:
            \code
            Acked-by:
            Initial-patch-by:
            Reported-by:
            Rubber-stamped-by:
            Signed-off-by:
            Tested-by:
            \endcode
            After you specify a file in this field, you can add authors as
            values of the submit message fields when submitting changes. If
            you also specified a \uicontrol{User/alias configuration file}, you can
            select authors in the \uicontrol Nicknames dialog.
        \li \uicontrol{SSH prompt command} specifies an ssh-askpass command that you
            can use (on Linux) to prompt the user for a password when using SSH.
            For example, \c ssh-askpass or \c x11-ssh-askpass, depending on the
            ssh-askpass implementation that you use.
        \li \uicontrol {Reset VCS Cache} resets the version control system
            configuration to a state known to \QC after you change it
            from the command line, for example.
    \endlist

    \section1 Show file status in Projects

    Requesting file status updates from files and showing them in \l {Projects}
    might slow down \QC.

    To show file status, go to \preferences > \uicontrol {Version Control}
    > \uicontrol General, and then select \uicontrol {Show VCS file status}.
